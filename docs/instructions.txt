“We usually advise candidates that they don’t spend more than 60 mins on it.

 

Please see attached for the details of the technical test, and an SQL dump of the data structure for it.

 

There are a number of tables. The ones which will be most relevant are

 

sykes_interview.property

sykes_interview.locations

sykes_interview.bookings

 

Primary keys are named __pk, and foreign keys are prefixed with _fk_.

For example _fk_property is a foreign key on the property table.

 

I wouldn’t spend more than an hour on it (but you can spend as little or as long as you like), we don’t expect you to complete it, it is like a Maths exam, where you get marks for showing your working (OOP, TDD). You are free to use a framework or composer if you wish to, but it is not required. You don’t need to produce something pretty, just keep it really simple. And if you adds a couple of tests around it – or even test drives it – even better.

 

I’d suggest an emphasis on simple but high quality. I’d far rather you did some tests than the availability search, for example. I’m not concerned about the time limit at all – I’d prefer to see something that reflects how you would actually approach the problem rather than the work they’d do under the pressure of a deadline as that doesn’t reflect how we work on a day to day basis.”
